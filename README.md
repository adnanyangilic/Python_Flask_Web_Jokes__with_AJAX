Python_Flask_Web_Jokes_with_AJAX   
I built project in Visual Studio 2019



Install newest Python language support packages onto Visual Studio.
Start a Python web project in Visual Studio. 
Right click to Python environments-->Python 3.9-->
Select "pip install flask" option from the selection options (most likely it is the first option)
After packages installed right click to project and add a new empty python file.
In this repo you can copy module1.py content and paste it into your new empty python file.
You can run the project.


I minified html file to a string with the help of https://codebeautify.org/minify-html
You must convert single quotes to double quotes.
I arranged that, when you run project by Visual Studio it runs at http://127.0.0.1:81
You can change it to a different port.
